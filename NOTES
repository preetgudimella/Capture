JSX
    JSX is tag-based like XML
    Each tag, like <View />, is transformed into a call to React.createElement()
    Any attributes become props of the instantiated component
    Attributes can be strings like foo='hello', or they can be interpolated JavaScript expressions when wrapped in curly braces as in bar={baz} (which would refer to the variable baz)
